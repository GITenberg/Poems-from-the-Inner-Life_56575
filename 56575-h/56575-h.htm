<h2><a name="A_WORD_TO_THE_WORLD" id="A_WORD_TO_THE_WORLD"></a>A WORD TO THE WORLD.</h2>

<p>In presenting this volume to the public, I trust that I may be allowed,
without incurring the charge of egotism, to say somewhat concerning my
spiritual experience, and the manner in which these poems were
originated. I am, in a measure, under the necessity of doing this, lest
some over-anxious friend, or would-be critic, should undertake the work
for me, and thereby place me, either unconsciously or intentionally, in
a false position before the public.</p>

<p>By the advice of those invisible intelligences, whose presence and power
I freely acknowledge, seconded by my own judgment, I have given to this
work the title of “Poems from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span> the Inner Life;” for, aside from the
external phenomena of Modern Spiritualism,&mdash;which, compared to the great
principles underlying them, are but mere froth and foam on the ocean of
Truth,&mdash;I have realized that in the mysterious depths of the Inner Life,
all souls can hold communion with those invisible beings, who are our
companions both in Time and Eternity. My vision has been dim and
indistinct, my hearing confused by the jarring discords of earthly
existence, and my utterances of a wisdom, higher than my own, impeded by
my selfish conceits and vain imaginings. Yet, notwithstanding all this,
the solemn convictions of my spiritual surroundings, and the mutual ties
of interest still existing between souls, “whether in the body or out of
the body,” have been indelibly impressed upon me. From such experiences
I have learned&mdash;in a sense hitherto unknown&mdash;that “the kingdom of Heaven
is within me.” I know that many sincere and earnest souls will decide at
once, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span> the integrity of their well-trained intellects, that this
claim to an intercourse with the invisible world is an extravagant
assumption, and has no foundation in truth. To such I would say, I shall
make no effort to persuade your reason and judgment. I only offer to you
as a suggestion, that which has been realized by me in my spiritual
experience, and has become to me an abiding truth, full of strength for
the present, and hope for the future. When your souls sincerely hunger
after such a revelation, you will seek for it, and according to your
need, you will be filled therewith. Until then, you and I, regarding
things from a different point of view, must inevitably understand them
differently. There are various cups which Humanity must drink of, and
“baptisms which it must be baptized with,” and this manifestation of
Truth, of which I am but one of the humble representatives, has laid its
controlling hand upon me; for what purpose, in the mysterious results
which lie concealed in the future, I cannot tell&mdash;I only know that it is
so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span></p>

<p>Looking back upon my experience, I cannot doubt that I&mdash;with many
others&mdash;was destined to this phase of development, and designed for this
peculiar work, before I knew conscious being. My brain was fashioned,
and my nervous system finely strung, so that I should inevitably catch
the thrill of the innumerable voices resounding through the universe,
and translate their messages into human language, as coherently and
clearly as my imperfections would allow. The early influences of my
childhood, the experiences of later years, and more than all, that
unutterable yearning for Beauty and Harmony, which I felt dimly
conscious was somewhere in the universe, all tended to drive me back
from the world, which would not and could not give me what I asked, to
the revelations of my inner life,&mdash;to the “Heaven within me.” It was
only through the cultivation of my spiritual nature that “spiritual
things were to be discerned,” and the stern necessity of my life was the
Teacher which finally educated me into the perception of Truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span></p>

<p>I turn back to the memories of my childhood&mdash;to that long course of
trying experiences through which I passed, guided by strange and
invisible influences; and that whole course of discipline has for me now
a peculiar significance. Those who were near and dear to me, and who
were most familiar with my habits of life, knew little of my intense
spiritual experience. I was too much afraid of being ridiculed and
misunderstood to dare give any expression to the strange and indefinable
emotions within me. Such ones, however, may call to mind the child who
often, through the long winter evenings, sat in profound silence by the
fireside, with her head and face enveloped in her apron, to exclude, as
far as possible, all external sight and sound. What I heard and saw then
but dimly returns to me; but even then the revelations from the “Heaven
within” had commenced, and succeeding years have so strengthened and
confirmed my vision, that such scenes have become to me living truths
and blessed realities. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> “Heaven” that “lay about me in my infancy”
sent its rich glow through my childhood, and sheds its mystic brightness
upon the pathway of my riper years.</p>

<p>Often, in the retirement of a small closet, I spent hours in total
darkness, lying prostrate on the floor, beating the waves of the
mysterious Infinite that rolled in a stormy flood over me, and with
prayers and tears beseeching deliverance from my blindness and seeming
unbelief. Then, when by my earnestness the spirit had become stronger
than the flesh, I would gradually fall into a deep trance, from which I
would arise strengthened and consoled by the assurance&mdash;from whence I
could not tell&mdash;that somewhere in the future I should find all the life,
and light, and freedom that my soul desired. The only evidence or
knowledge which those around me received of such visitations was
occasionally a poem&mdash;some of them written so early in life, that the
childish chirography rendered them almost illegible. Because of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xi" id="page_xi">{xi}</a></span> these
early productions, it has been asserted that my claim to any individual
spirit-influence was either a falsehood or delusion. I will only say in
reply, that there is no need of entering upon any argument on the
subject. I claim both a general and particular inspiration. They do not,
by any means, conflict; and what I do not receive from one, comes from
the other. For the very reason that I have natural poetic tendencies, I
attract influences of a kindred nature; and when I desire it, or they
will to do so, they cast their characteristic inspirations upon me, and
I give them utterance according to my ability. It is often as difficult
to decide what is the action of one’s own intellect and what is
spirit-influence, as it is in our ordinary associations to determine
what is original with ourselves and what we have received from
circumstances or contact with the mind of others. Yet, nevertheless,
there are cases where the distinction is so evident that it is not to be
doubted. Only one or two such well-attest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xii" id="page_xii">{xii}</a></span>ed instances is sufficient to
establish the theory. I am not willing to ignore one faculty or power of
my being for the sake of proving a favorite idea; and, on the contrary,
I cannot conscientiously deny that, in the mysteries of my inner life, I
have been acted upon decidedly and directly by disembodied
intelligences, and this, sometimes, by an inspiration characteristic of
the individual, or by a psychological influence similar to that whereby
mind acts upon mind in the body. Under such influences I have not
necessarily lost my individuality, or become wholly unconscious. I was,
for the time being, like a harp in the hands of superior powers, and
just in proportion as my entire nature was attuned to thrill responsive
to their touch, did I give voice and expression to their unwritten
music. They furnished the inspiration, but it was of necessity modified
by the nature and character of the instrument upon which they played,
for the most skilful musician cannot change the tone of a harp to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii">{xiii}</a></span>
sound of a trumpet, though he may give a characteristic expression of
himself through either.</p>

<p>The presence and influence of these powers is to me no new or recent
occurrence, although I may not have understood them in the same light as
I do at present. They have formed a part of all my past life, and I can
trace the evidence of spiritual assistance running like a golden thread
through all my intellectual efforts. As I do not desire to practise any
deception upon the public, but on the contrary only wish to declare the
simple truth, I have published in this volume quite a number of poems,
written several years previous to my appearance before the public as a
medium or a speaker. Although these were mostly wrought out of my brain
by the slow process of thought, yet for some of these, even, I can claim
as direct and special an inspiration as for those delivered upon the
platform. The first poem in this present work,&mdash;“The Prayer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv">{xiv}</a></span>
Sorrowing,”&mdash;and that which immediately succeeds it,&mdash;“The Song of
Truth,”&mdash;containing in itself an answer to the Prayer, were given to me
under peculiar circumstances. The first was the language of my own soul,
intensified by an occasion of great mental anguish. The second,
following directly upon it, was an illumination of my entire being, when
I seemed to have wept away the scales from my eyes, and “by the deep
conflict of my soul in prayer,” to have broken the fetters of my
mortality, and stepped forth into that freedom whereby I stood face to
face with the ministering spirits, and heard that “Song of Truth”
sounding through the universe. I have only known but few such
visitations in my lifetime, but when they have come, I have felt that I
have taken a free, deep breath of celestial air, and caught a glimpse of
the Realities of Things. As an immediate consequence, my spirit has
become braver and stronger, and long after my inward vision was closed,
the cheering light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv">{xv}</a></span> that blessed revelation has lingered in my heart.</p>

<p>Another poem, which bore evidence to me of an inspiration acting upon
me, and external to myself, was the “Song of the North,” relating to the
fate of Sir John Franklin and his men. I was desired to write an
illustration for a plate, about to appear in the “Lily of the Valley,”
an Annual published by J. M. Usher, of Cornhill, Boston. I endeavored to
do so, but day after day passed by and my labor was in vain, for not one
acceptable idea would suggest itself. The publisher sent for the
article, but it was not in being. One day, however, I was seized with an
indefinable uneasiness. I wandered up and down through the house and
garden, till finally the idea of what I was to do became clearly
defined; then, with my paper and pencil, I hastened to a quiet corner in
the attic, where nearly all my poems had been written, and there I wrote
the Song of the North&mdash;so rapidly, that it was scarce legi<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvi" id="page_xvi">{xvi}</a></span>ble, and I
was obliged to copy it at once, lest I should lose the connection. The
next day it seemed as foreign and strange to me as it would to any one
who had never seen it. At the time this was written (in April, 1853)
strong hopes were entertained of the discovery of Franklin and his men,
together with their safe return; therefore I hesitated to make public
that which seemed a decided affirmation to the contrary. Nevertheless,
so strong were my convictions as to the truth of the poem, that I
allowed it to be published. Later revelations concerning the fate of
that brave adventurer and his companions gave to the poem somewhat of
the character of a prophecy.</p>

<p>How far I have ever written, independent of these higher influences, I
cannot say; I only know that all the poems under my own name have come
from the deep places of my “Inner Life;” and in that self-same sacred
retreat&mdash;which I have entered either by the intense concentration of all
my intellectual powers, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvii" id="page_xvii">{xvii}</a></span> passive surrender to the inspirations that
moved upon me&mdash;I have held conscious communion with disembodied spirits.
At such times it has been said I was “entranced;” and although that term
does not exactly express my idea, perhaps it is the best which can yet
be found in our language. The avenues of external sense, if not entirely
closed, were at least disused, in order that the spiritual perceptions
might be quickened to the required degree, and also that the world of
causes, of which earth and its experiences are but the passing effects,
might be disclosed to my vision. Certain it is that a physical change
took place, affecting both my breathing and circulation, and my
clairvoyant powers were so strengthened that I could dimly perceive
external objects from the frontal portion of my brain, even with my eyes
closed and bandaged; also, in that state, any excess of light was far
more painful than under ordinary conditions. If the communications given
through my instrumentality have been weak, erroneous, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xviii" id="page_xviii">{xviii}</a></span> imperfect, it
is no fault of my spirit-teachers, but arises rather from my own
inability to understand or clearly express what was communicated to me.</p>

<p>In relation to the poems given under direct spirit-influence I would
say, that there has been a mistake existing in many minds concerning
them, which I take the present opportunity, as far as possible, to
correct. They were not like lightning flashes, coming unheralded, and
vanishing without leaving a trace behind. Several days before they were
given, I would receive intimations of them. Oftentimes, and particularly
under the influence of Poe, I would awake in the night from a deep
slumber, and detached fragments of those poems would be floating through
my mind, though in a few moments after they would vanish like a dream. I
have sometimes awakened myself by repeating them aloud. I have been
informed, also, by these influences, that all their poems are as
complete and finished in spirit-life as they are in this, and the only
reason why they cannot be repeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xix" id="page_xix">{xix}</a></span>ed again and again is because of the
difficulty of bringing a human organism always into the same state of
exaltation&mdash;a state in which mediums readily receive inspiration, and
render the poems with the least interference of their own intellect.</p>

<p>Among these spiritual poems will be found two purporting to come from
Shakspeare. This influence seemed to overwhelm and crush me. I was
afraid, and shrank from it. Only those two poems were given, and then
the attempt was not repeated. I do not think that the poems in
themselves come up to the productions of his master mind. They are only
intimations of what might have been, if he had had a stronger and more
effectual instrument upon which to pour his inspirations. I have no
doubt that time will yet furnish one upon whom his mantle will fall; but
I can only say that his power was mightier than I could bear. As I have
regarded him spiritually, he seems to be a majestic intellect, but one
that overawes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xx" id="page_xx">{xx}</a></span> rather than attracts me; and my conclusion has been, that
while in the flesh, although he was of himself a mighty mind, yet still
he spake wiser than he knew, being moved upon by those superior powers
who choose men for their mouthpieces, and oblige them to speak startling
words into the dull ear of the times. As all Nature is a manifestation
of Deity, so all Humanity is a manifestation of mind,&mdash;differing,
however, in degrees of development,&mdash;and one body serves as an
instrument to effect the purposes of many minds. This is illustrated in
the pursuits and employments of ordinary life, and has a far deeper
significance when taken in connection with the invisible world.</p>

<p>The influence of Burns was pleasant, easy, and exhilarating, and left me
in a cheerful mood. As a spirit, he seemed to be genial and kindly, with
a clear perception and earnest love of simple truth, and at the same
time a good-natured contempt for all shams, mere forms, and solemn
mockeries. This was the way in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxi" id="page_xxi">{xxi}</a></span> he impressed me, and I felt much
more benefited than burdened by his presence.</p>

<p>The first poem delivered by Poe, came to me far more unexpectedly than
any other. By referring to the introductory remarks, copied from the
“Springfield Republican,” it will be seen that the supposition is
presented, that I, or “the one who wrote the poem,” must have been very
familiar with the writings of Poe. As no one wrote the poem for me,
consequently I am the only one who can answer to the supposition; and I
can say, most conscientiously, that previous to that time I had never
read, to my knowledge, any of his poems, save “The Raven,” and I had not
seen that for several years. Indeed, I may well say in this connection,
that I have read, comparatively speaking, very little poetry in the
course of my life, and have never made the style of any author a study.
The influence of Poe was neither pleasant nor easy. I can only describe
it as a species of mental intoxication. I was tortured<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxii" id="page_xxii">{xxii}</a></span> with a feeling
of great restlessness and irritability, and strange, incongruous images
crowded my brain. Some were bewildering and dazzling as the sun, others
dark and repulsive. Under his influence, particularly, I suffered the
greatest exhaustion of vital energy, so much so, that after giving one
of his poems, I was usually quite ill for several days.</p>

<p>But from his first poem to the last,&mdash;“The Farewell to Earth,”&mdash;was a
marked, and rapid change. It would seem as though, in that higher life,
where the opportunities for spiritual development far transcend those of
earth, that by his quick and active perceptions he had seized upon the
Divine Idea which was endeavoring to find expression through his life,
both in Time and Eternity; and that from the moment this became
apparent, with a volcanic energy, with the battle-strokes of a true
hero, he had overthrown every obstacle, and hewn a way through<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiii" id="page_xxiii">{xxiii}</a></span> every
barrier that impeded the free outgrowth and manifestation of his diviner
self. His “Farewell” is not a mere poem of the imagination. It is a
record of facts. I can clearly perceive, as his spirit has been revealed
to me, that there was a deep significance in his words, when he said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">“I will sunder, and forever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every tie of <i>human passion</i> that can bind my soul to Earth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every <i>slavish</i> tie that binds me to the things of little worth.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As he last appeared to me, he was full of majesty and strength,
self-poised and calm, and it would seem by the expression of his
countenance, radiant with victory, that the reward promised to “him that
overcometh,” had been made his sure possession. Around his brow, as a
spiritual emblem, was an olive-wreath, whose leaves glowed like fire. He
stood upon the side of a mountain, which was white and glittering like
crystal, and the full tide of inspiration to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiv" id="page_xxiv">{xxiv}</a></span> which he gave utterance
could not be comprehended in human speech. That last “Farewell,” as it
found expression through my weak lips, was but the faintest possible
echo of that most musical and majestic lyric which thrilled the
harp-strings of my being. In order to be fully realized and understood,
the soul must be transported to that sphere of spiritual <i>perceptions</i>,
where there is no <i>audible</i> “speech nor language,” and where the “voice
is not <i>heard</i>.”</p>

<p>Obedient to the call of the Angels, he has “gone up higher” in the ways
of Eternal Progress; and though, because of this change, he may no
longer manifest himself as he <i>was</i>, yet doubtless as he <i>is</i>, he will
yet be felt as a Presence and a Power in the “Heaven” of many a human
heart. Upon earth he was a meteor light, flashing with a startling
brilliancy across the intellectual firmament; but now he is a star of
ever-increasing magnitude, which has at length<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxv" id="page_xxv">{xxv}</a></span> gravitated to its own
place among the celestial spheres.</p>

<p>In saying thus much, I cannot so play the coward to my spiritual
convictions as to offer the slightest apology for any ideas I may have
advanced contrary to popular prejudices or time-honored opinions. O,
thoughtful reader! if I have offended thee, say simply that these are
<i>my</i> convictions and not <i>yours</i>, and do not fear for the result; for in
whatsoever I purpose or perform, I “can do nothing against the
Truth&mdash;only for it.” I do not indulge in the conceit that this little
work has any important mission to perform, or that it will cause any
commotion in the literary world. But I have felt, as one by one these
poems have been wrought out&mdash;by general or special inspiration&mdash;from my
“Inner Life,” that in this matter I had a work, simple though it might
be, to do, and my soul was sorely “straitened till it was
accomplished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxvi" id="page_xxvi">{xxvi}</a></span>”</p>

<p>As some of these poems, appearing at various times, have been severely
criticized in the past, so I would say now, that if any there should be,
who, through bigotry, or prejudice, or a desire to display their
superior wisdom, should choose to criticize them in their present
form&mdash;to such I shall make no answer. But to all those earnest and
inquiring souls, who feel that in such experiences as I have described,
or in the resources from which my soul has drawn its supply, there is
aught that is attractive or desirable to them, I would say, “God speed
you in your search for Truth!” At the same time let me assure you, that
in the depths of your own Inner Life there is a fountain of inspiration
and wisdom, which, if sought aright, will yield you more abundant
satisfaction than any simple cup of the living water which I, or any
other individual, can place to your lips. There are invisible teachers
around you, the hem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxvii" id="page_xxvii">{xxvii}</a></span> whose garments I am unworthy to touch. “The
words that they speak unto you&mdash;they are Spirit and they are Life.” “In
order to <i>know</i> more you must <i>be</i> more.” Faith strikes its roots deep
in the spirit, and often Intuition is a safer guide than Reason. When a
man, by constant practice, has so quickened his spiritual perceptions
that he can receive conscious impressions from his invisible attendants,
he will never be without counsellors.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“Let Faith be given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the still tones that oft our being waken&mdash;<br /></span>

<p>The Spirit-World is not so distant as it seems, and the veil of
Materiality which hides it from our view, by hopeful and untiring
aspiration can be rent in twain. We only need listen earnestly and
attentively, and we shall soon learn to keep step in the grand march of
Life to the music of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxviii" id="page_xxviii">{xxviii}</a></span> the upper spheres. As a popular author has
beautifully said, “Silence is vocal, if we listen well.” With a sublime
accord, the great anthem of the Infinite “rolls and resounds” through
the Universe, and whosoever will, can listen to that harmony, till all
special and particular discords shall die out from the “Inner Life,” and
the Heaven of the celestial intelligences shall blend with the “Heaven
within,” in perfect unison!<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_1" id="page_1">{1}</a></span></p>

<p class="sml">“In March, of 1854, says the Cleveland Herald, several months before the
arrival of Dr. Rae, with his news of the probable death of the brave Sir
John Franklin and his faithful comrades, we copied from the Lily of the
Valley for 1854, a beautiful poem by Miss Lizzie Doten, in reference to
these adventurers. The verses are touching and solemn as the sound of a
passing bell, and appear <i>almost prophetic</i> of the news that afterwards
came. ‘The Song of the North’ again becomes deeply interesting as
connected with the thrilling account brought home by the Fox&mdash;the last
vessel sent in search of the lost adventurers to the icy North, and the
last that will now ever be sent on such an expedition.”&mdash;<i>Buffalo Daily

<h3><a name="MY_SPIRIT-HOME" id="MY_SPIRIT-HOME"></a>MY SPIRIT-HOME.</h3>

<p class="sml">“We find the following beautiful stanzas in the Evening Courier,
published in Portland, Me. They were composed in spirit-life by Miss A.
W. Sprague, and spoken under spirit influence by Miss Lizzie Doten, at
the close of her lecture in that city, on Sunday evening, March 22d. The
lines are evidently from the spirit of Miss Sprague, who passed to the
spirit-world last summer, from her home in Vermont, as there are
allusions in it to incidents which took place during her illness, in
Oswego, N. Y., about a year since. Allusion is also made to a poem
written by her and published in the <i>Banner</i>, and also to another poem
of hers, ‘I wait, I wait at the golden gate.’<span class="lftspc">”</span>&mdash;<i>Banner of Light.</i></p>

<h3><a name="RESURREXI" id="RESURREXI"></a>RESURREXI.</h3>

<p class="sml">“<span class="smcap">A Remarkable Poem.</span>&mdash;The following striking poem was recited by Miss
Lizzie Doten, a Spiritual trance-speaker, at the close of a recent
lecture in Boston. She professed to give it impromptu, as far as she was
concerned, and to speak under the direct influence of Edgar A. Poe.
Whatever may be the truth about its production, the poem is, in several
respects, a remarkable one. Miss Doten is, apparently, incapable of
originating such a poem. If it was written for her by some one else, and
merely committed to memory and recited by her, the poem is,
nevertheless, wonderful as a reproduction of the singular music and
alliteration of Poe’s style, and as manifesting the same intensity of
feeling. Whoever wrote the poem must have been exceedingly familiar with
Poe, and deeply in sympathy with his spirit. But if Miss Doten is
honest, and the poem originated as she said it did, it is unquestionably
the most astonishing thing that Spiritualism has produced. It does not
follow, necessarily, in that case, that Poe himself made the
poem,&mdash;although we are asked to believe a great many spiritual things on
less cogent evidence,&mdash;but it is, in any view of it that may be taken, a
very singular and mysterious production. There is, in the second verse,
an allusion to a previous poem that purported to come from the spirit of
Poe, which was published several years since, and attracted much
attention, but the following poem is of a higher order, and much more
like Poe than the other.”&mdash;<i>Springfield Republican.</i></p>

<h3><a name="THE_PROPHECY_OF_VALA" id="THE_PROPHECY_OF_VALA"></a>THE PROPHECY OF VALA.<br /><br />
<small>[Given under the inspiration of Edgar A. Poe.]</small></h3>

<p class="sml">The Prophecy of Vala is founded on the Scandinavian mythology. Odin, the
great All Father, is the sovereign power of the universe; Thor, a lesser
god, of whom it is said, “his mighty hammer smote thunder out of every
thing.” Baldur was a son of Odin and Frigga. He was slain by Hörder, his
blind brother, who was persuaded to the act by Loké, an evil spirit,
corresponding to the Hebrew or Christian devil. The Valkyrien were the
genii of the battle-field. The three Nornen were the Fates who watered
the tree Yggdrasill, at whose roots it is said that a dragon was
constantly gnawing. The Heimskringla was the circle of the universe.
Vala was a seeress, or prophetess, who was summoned from the dead by
Odin, to tell of the fate of Baldur; but on her appearance refused to do
so, and to the astonishment of all, prophesied the death of all the sons
of Odin at the day of Ragnaroc, which corresponds to the day of
judgment, with the exception that it was also the day of reconstruction,
or renewal of the world. The Prophecy of Vala, as given in the old
Icelandic Edda, has been used with perfect freedom, to present the idea
that Good, though apparently overcome of Evil, should ultimately
triumph.&mdash;<i>Explanation by Poe.</i></p>

<span class="i0">A sound like the rushing tempest, and the wondrous hammer fell,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like the gnomes at their fiery forges&mdash;like the bowlings of restless ghouls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then out of the fiery covert of the tempest and the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a vision of troubled slumber, came a woman’s stately form.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There fell a hush as at midnight, when the sheeted dead awake,<br /></span>

<p class="sml">“<span class="smcap">Edgar A. Poe.</span>&mdash;As the circumstances attendant upon the death of Poe are
not generally known, it may be well to present the facts in connection
with the following poem. Having occasion to pass through Baltimore a few
days before his intended marriage with a lady of family and fortune in
Virginia, Poe met with some of his old associates, who induced him to
drink with them, although, as we are informed, he had entirely abstained
for a year. This aroused the appetite which had so long slumbered within
him, and in a short time he wandered forth into the street in a state of
drunken delirium, and was found next morning literally dying from
exposure. He was taken to a hospital, and on the 7th of October, 1849,
at the age of thirty-eight, he closed his troubled life. The tortures
and terrors of that night of suffering are vividly portrayed in the
following poem, composed in spirit-life, and given by him through the
mediumship of Miss Lizzie Doten, at the conclusion of her lecture in
Baltimore, on Sunday evening, January 11, 1863.”&mdash;<i>Banner of Light.</i></p>

<p class="c">A LECTURE DELIVERED BY MISS LIZZIE DOTEN, AT CLINTON HALL, MONDAY, P.
M., NOV. 2, 1863.</p>

<p class="csml">[Phonographically reported by Robert S. Moore.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> several reasons, we must be as brief and comprehensive as possible
in our remarks to-night. We do not intend to make any great intellectual
effort, or to endeavor to astonish you with lofty strains of eloquence.
We simply desire to present to you a few facts in connection with the
poem about to be given, and we do this under the distinctive title of
our discourse,&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Mysteries of Godliness</span>.</p>

<p>As Godliness was a mystery in the past, so is it in the present. And why
is it a mystery? Because men understand so little of the <i>practice</i> of
Godliness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span> Socrates was accustomed to say that “a man was always
sufficiently eloquent in that which he clearly understood;” and thus a
man will not look upon that as a mystery which is a part of his daily
life, and with which he has become familiar through experience. But as
it was in the days when Jesus lived and taught, or when Paul wrote his
Epistle to Timothy, so Godliness, to the great mass of minds, remains a
mystery. When Paul penned those words,&mdash;“Without controversy, great is
the mystery of Godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in
the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in
the world, and received up into glory,”&mdash;he referred particularly to the
life and teachings of Jesus. We, however, give to the passage a more
comprehensive and extended application. If the “Mystery of Godliness”
was made manifest in the life of Jesus because of his divinity, then do
we say to the men of the present day, “Beloved, now are ye also sons of
God.” And if “the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in the midst of men,”
in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, so that same Word is incarnated, in
greater or less degree, in every human being, be he rich or poor, black
or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span> white, bond or free. In the same way, also, every one possessing a
living soul is a manifestation of the mystery of Godliness. And when a
man goes into his own nature, when he understands himself, when he reads
the mysteries of his own being, when he looks away from his positive and
earthly necessities up to his Divine possibilities, and sees how vast is
the range, how infinite his capabilities, then he begins to understand
something of the mysteries of Godliness. The Church has used this
phraseology in the past, and knew not what it meant. She had “the form
of Godliness,” and yet in word and deed, ay, in very thought, she
“denied the power thereof.” Therefore it has been, in all past time,
when there were some true and sincere souls in the Church, who made
manifest, both by profession and practice, that in part at least, they
comprehended the mystery of Godliness, which is the highest
spirituality,&mdash;not Spiritualism,&mdash;and let it flow out into the beauty
and harmony of perfect lives, the Church looked at them with a doubtful
countenance. There was such a thing as being too holy, and the Church
felt that such lives were a reproach to her self-righteousness and
hypocrisy. She was not familiar with the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span>ifestation of true
Godliness, and consequently looked upon it as something that threatened
her internal peace, and the success of her stereotyped plan of
salvation. Therefore it was, that the voice of condemnation was raised
against Michael De Molinos, Fenelon, Madame Guyon, and the whole host of
Quietists and Reformers. By dim forecastings of the soul, and heroic
struggling with flesh and sense, they had learned something of that holy
mystery. It was that which could not be translated into human language.
It could not be written in books, but it was that which was to be felt
in the soul, and made manifest in the life. Godliness, true
spirituality, cannot find expression in words, and so it must of
necessity manifest its Divine beauty in the life.</p>

<p>But what is the idea we intend to convey when we use the term
“Godliness”? Who is God, from whose name this word is simply a
derivative? Godliness is the manifestation of his spirit and power in
the soul of man, yet it is not God. Who, then, is He! We must look into
the lexicon of every human heart to find our reply; for each one
worships his own Ideal of Deity according to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span>revelation of Truth
which he receives, and to the capacity of his spirit to comprehend. The
old philosophers sought for God in all the external world; they also
went down into the mysteries of the spirit, as far as philosophy could
sound its mighty depths, and yet they could not fathom his infinite
nature. Although form and an external are necessary to man as a
completion of his idea, yet when he reasons deeply concerning Deity, he
cannot arrive at any satisfactory conclusions concerning his
personality; he can only worship him as a principle, as a presence, and
a power. Man, in his insignificance, can only look up to that superior
Intelligence, which manifests itself throughout Nature, and worship
either in the silence of the heart or in the inadequate articulations of
human speech. The finite never did as yet compass and comprehend the
Infinite. And before that majestic question which all the Ages have
sought in vain to answer, before that mighty Oracle whose essence and
nature have never been understood, man might as well remain dumb.</p>

<p>But where, you ask, shall man find his highest manifestation of Deity?
How shall he know and understand God, so that he may attain unto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span>
true mystery of Godliness? The most of God that you can know is through
your own souls. Your neighbor may speak unto you of the influences which
flow in upon him from the great Soul of all; you can only listen, but
cannot comprehend, unless there is something of the same spirit&mdash;of the
same Divine life within you. But as you grow in goodness and
spirituality, you comprehend more clearly the truth which Jesus, the
greatest Medium the world ever knew, spoke to the ears of men, when he
said, “God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth.” Therefore our definition of Godliness is
spirituality, the influence of God felt in the soul and made manifest in
the life of man. Just in proportion as this principle or power is
realized in the hearts of men, they approach nearer unto Deity; they see
more of his perfect life; they understand more of his ways; they leave
speculations concerning his personality, and go away to those great
generalizations whereby a man’s soul grows comprehensive and universal
in its sympathies, and beholds the operations of the Infinite mind in
all things. Thus, as Jesus was a manifestation of that Godliness or
spirituality, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span> self-same Divine power&mdash;the “Divine in the human” is
manifest in every sentient being.</p>

<p>And here we approach a mighty truth, in whose majestic presence we feel
inclined to lay aside our dusty sandals; for the place whereon we stand
seems holy ground. While studying the mysteries of our own being, we
find that necessarily we worship Everlasting Truth, in whatever form it
may be presented. We go away from limitations, we go away from sects and
creeds, from tottering institutions and the musty theologies of the
past, and stand face to face with that fresher revelation of Deity in
the heart. Then it is that man feels there are primary and fundamental
truths lying at the basis of all philosophy and all religion, and only
as he builds upon these broad foundations can he rear a glorious
superstructure against which all the winds of changing theories, and the
descending floods of mere speculative philosophy, will not be able to
prevail. As man, like one initiated into the mysteries of Masonry,
enters into this lodge of freedom, he begins to believe in himself. No
man can have faith in God who has no faith in himself; that is the first
step towards the Divine. You take that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span> step in the secret of the soul
when you first acknowledge the “Divine in the human,” and confess its
supporting influence.</p>

<p>For instance, two men may be standing on the borders of a precipice:
below, there is the deep ravine; opposite, the other side of the
mountain. They look far down and see rough, ragged points of rocks, and
far, far below, the floods boiling white with foam. Over this abyss
there is but one slight, frail bridge, and that is the trunk of a single
tree. One man says, “Since we must pass over, I will precede. I know
that I can go; I <i>will</i> go.” That man has faith in himself. He plants
his feet firmly; he looks upward, and passes safely over. The second
says, “I do not believe that I can go; I fear I shall fall.” He totters
on, trembling, until he reaches the middle, and then cries out, “O Lord,
Lord, help me!” So surely as he utters that cry, faithless in his own
power, that man must fall.</p>

<p>And thus it is with human souls. They are standing here, in earthly
life, gazing across the great abyss of the Future. It is dark and
terrible below. They cannot clearly understand what fate awaits them,
but they see the strait and narrow way before<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">{142}</a></span> them. If a man plants his
feet firmly, and says, “I can, and I will,” it is the greatest possible
acknowledgement of his faith in God. That man has stepped upon the
threshold of the mysteries of Godliness; those mysteries will be made
clearer and more apparent to his soul as he advances. But if, with
craven soul, he says, “I know not what to do. I will wait for God’s
providences, and let them come as they may; for of myself I can do
nothing,”&mdash;if he trust to the vicarious atonement and an external Deity,
and does nothing for his own salvation,&mdash;if, in making oral prayers to
the Lord of the Universe, he forgets to “worship God in spirit,” and
loses the vitalizing consciousness of the Divine within his own being,
that man will assuredly err; he will continually go astray, for
externally he has “the form of Godliness,” but practically and
internally he denies “the power thereof.”</p>

<p>The world to-day is standing, in a certain sense, in that same position.
Men are lifting up their hands, and crying, “Lord, Lord!” believing that
they shall thus enter into the kingdom, while within their own beings
there is a broad region of spiritual mysteries unknown and unexplored.
Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_143" id="page_143">{143}</a></span> and there are instances where souls, driven by the action of their
own importunate reason,&mdash;ay, we may say, by simple common sense,&mdash;have
turned aside from creeds and theories, and have inquired earnestly of
Nature and of the God within. It is refreshing at times to find such a
soul: one that believes in the inspiration of the living Word,
incarnated in all flesh, and made apparent throughout the universe,&mdash;not
a Pantheist, believing in the manifestation of Deity in Nature alone,
and in nothing higher, but realizing that the creation is the
perceptible and external revelation of Deity; believing, with the German
philosopher Fichte, that “there is a Divine Idea pervading this visible
universe; which visible universe is indeed but its symbol and sensible
manifestation, having in itself no meaning, or even true existence,
independent of it. To the mass of men this Divine Idea lies hidden; yet,
to discern it, to seize it, and live wholly in it, is the condition of
all genuine virtue, knowledge, freedom, and the end, therefore, of all
spiritual effort in every age.” He who lives and dwells in this Idea,
enters into the mysteries of Godliness. All divine things are
exceedingly sim<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_144" id="page_144">{144}</a></span>ple when they are known. It is because men are looking
too high that they do not receive the living inspirations of the Truth;
they turn away from themselves, and neglect to observe the manifestation
of the spirit within their own being. They look upon their brother man
or sister woman, and forget to exercise that broad charity which sees
the spirit struggling with the flesh, or feebly breasting the wild waves
of a tempestuous life, simply because it was thus constituted and
surrounded. Men commonly judge from their own individual stand-point,
instead of going away back to the Divinity of the inner life, and from
its pure eyes looking into the heart of their erring brother or sister.
He who simply criticizes the man, and judges him by the limitations of
his own life, errs greatly. But he who looks beyond and behind him, sees
that there are truths, and principles, and powers, and loving, earnest
spirits, who are endeavoring to make manifest their inspiration through
him; and although he may be changeable in his nature, although he may be
erratic and wandering, it is only through the excess of power that
cannot find an appropriate manifestation through such an organization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span></p>

<p>And such a one was he of whom we speak to-night,&mdash;that erratic genius,
<span class="smcap">Edgar A. Poe</span>. The mysteries of Godliness,&mdash;not of morality, as the world
understands it,&mdash;confounded him. He could see more clearly than most of
men. He looked out into the vast arcana of Nature, and his soul trembled
before the majestic revelation. He knew not how to express, in any
adequate form of speech, those great and mighty thoughts which rose and
shone, like stars of wondrous beauty, in his soul; he knew not how to
give his burning inspirations a manifestation through his life and
being.</p>

<p>Edgar A. Poe was a medium. “A medium!” you say. “He himself would scorn
the name; and we, who knew him, deny it.” But of what was he a medium?
We do not confine ourselves to that definition of the term given by
modern Spiritualists. He was a medium for the general inspiration which
sets like a current of living fire through the universe. No special, no
individual spirit wrought directly upon him, but he felt the might and
majesty of occult forces from the world of causes, and trembled beneath
their influence. He was a medium, not to disembodied spirits, only so
far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146">{146}</a></span> mind acts upon mind by the great law of unity, and in the same
way was he psychologically affected by spirits in the body. He had a
peculiarly sensitive and impressible nature, and in the mysteries of a
spirituality which he did not seek to comprehend, he was easily wrought
upon by the minds around him. Not but what he possessed self-will; not,
indeed, that he lacked that firmness, whereby, when his soul was
aroused, he could repel such influences. But his nature was so finely
strung that every harsh word, every unkindly discord, grated and
thrilled through his entire being, so that oftentimes it would seem as
though he would beat down the wall of clay to give his spirit freedom,
and to escape forever from the inharmonious influences of the
world,&mdash;from the presence of those by whom he was so little understood.</p>

<p>It is difficult to comprehend such natures, for they are not common.
But, alas for such! They have no choice but to be denizens of this
world, and all the rough, sharp angles of rude Humanity seem continually
to wound and irritate their sensitiveness, torturing them almost to
madness. And yet there is a deep, strong under-current to their lives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span>
There is a beautiful spirituality which leads men to perceive that there
is a power in the universe which balances all these inequalities and
apparent inharmonies of human beings; and so, although they are set at
variance with the world in certain portions of their nature, yet they
are rewarded in others. Edgar A. Poe possessed the power of retiring
from external things into the mysteries of the spirit. The greatest
authors and musical composers the world ever knew, were those whose
favorite pursuit so completely absorbed them that all external things
were excluded, and they forgot, while their inspirations were upon them,
what manner of men they were,&mdash;forgot the necessities of the flesh, and
all the surroundings of their daily lives. Such men could understand our
meaning, when we say that Edgar A. Poe lived much in his inner life, and
there, as in the experience of the soul-rapt and inspired Boehmen,
glorious revelations of the sublime and the beautiful were made manifest
unto him. The common forms of human speech were inadequate for
expression; therefore he seized upon the secret harmony of words, and
strung them like flashing gems on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_148" id="page_148">{148}</a></span> golden line of his thought,
weaving them into wild, strange metaphors, oftentimes so bewildering and
dazzling, that the common mind could only feel the charm without
comprehending the mystery. Like Ezekiel in his vision, he beheld the
wondrous “living creatures, and the wheels,” and as they were
represented, so did he describe them; but the mind of the reader must be
in a similar state of illumination in order to clearly understand his
meaning. There were seasons when he seemed to enter into a peaceful
alliance with earth and all harmonious and beautiful things. Yet when
his peculiarly sensitive nature was startled and aroused, he turned back
to this Valhalla of his soul, and there he found another element of
peace,&mdash;a strange, paradoxical peace, which comes through the herculean
efforts of the soul to clamber up the rugged heights of destiny,&mdash;such
peace as is given unto souls, when the angel, with a flaming sword,
drives them from the Eden places of this world back into the mysteries
of their being, in order that from their bloody sweat and bitter agony
they may wring out great songs of moving inspiration, and reveal to
mankind generally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_149" id="page_149">{149}</a></span> wondrous world of ideas and causes which lies
beyond the limits of sense and the range of external observation.</p>

<p>All such are men of Destiny. They are compelled over the ways which they
tread. The world looks upon them, and cannot understand them; men
consider them as anomalies and strange inconsistencies; as abnormal
manifestations of the spirit. Yet “for this cause came they into the
world;” and as poets, and artists, and musical composers are born with
the undeveloped elements of their genius within them, so particular
souls, in close connection with the spiritual world, who are continually
receiving direct impressions and revelations from the sphere of causes,
are born such from their cradle; and thus the mystery of spirituality or
godliness, as the world passes on generation after generation, is
becoming more and more apparent in the lives and experiences of men.
When we speak of spirituality, do not consider that we mean modern
Spiritualism, as understood by the world, which has furnished any amount
of sheep’s clothing to the wolves who desire to prey upon the lambs in
the unguarded fold of Humanity. Neither do we mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span> that inflated
spirituality, which, in its zeal for reform, and contempt for ceremonies
and limitations, rushes to extremes, and, deceiving itself, “uses its
liberty as an occasion to the flesh.” But we do mean that living
principle, which makes itself manifest in high-toned souls, whose
sublime aspirations exalt the whole life above the common level of
Humanity. It may come out as a fitful and glimmering light, but it shows
that the Divine inspiration is there, and all men, when they perceive
it, are ready to acknowledge it as genuine. Whatever is truly good,
glorious, or divine, that which possesses in itself real merit and
inspiration, cannot fail to find a responsive echo. And thus was it with
the writings of Poe. When, from the glowing fire-crypts of his soul, he
wrought out, with master strokes, his “Raven,” and gave it to the world,
men felt that there was the ring of true genius. And, although it was
the utterance of a nature at variance with its earthy surroundings, and
tortured by its own sensibility, yet because of its gloomy grandeur and
euphonious rhythm, the poem could not fail to be appreciated.</p>

<p>Such natures cannot live long in the flesh. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span> are like two-edged
swords, which wear upon the scabbard. There is ever an unseen hand upon
the hilt, and finally, when the word of command is given, the sword is
drawn, and becomes a most effective instrument in the hand of
Everlasting Truth; then the individual nature that has so long battled
the stormy elements of mortal life first perceives its advantages, and
in the triumphant exultation which spirits always feel when freed from
the fetters of mortality, it exclaims, “O Death! where is thy sting? O
Grave! where is thy victory?” That diviner spirituality which was
obscured by the flesh, which was crushed down by earthly circumstances,
at length frees itself, and starts up in all its majesty and glory. But
the mysterious growth and development of the spirit does not end here.</p>

<p>Perhaps in this connection we may present to you certain points from
which you will feel obliged to dissent. They may seem like vague
theories and wild speculations, yet they are truths which you are yet to
realize in your eternal experience,&mdash;truths which this one of whom we
speak will present to you in repetition to-night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span></p>

<p>There is a power in man which is closely connected with the things of
external life, and draws inspiration from nature and the associations of
his fellow-men. There is a power, also, in every human being superior to
the spirit, and that is the soul, or innermost life&mdash;which is a divine
and indestructible principle. When, therefore, the garment of flesh is
laid aside,&mdash;when the mortal puts on its immortality,&mdash;the spirit goes
forth precisely as it is. If it has been under the influence of
ungoverned passion; if it has striven, through mad ambition, to attain
to some cherished ideal, still does it feel that impetus, and its
earthly longings and aspirations must pass away through a gradual
transformation. You may dissent from this, but the change of the earthly
garment does not effect a radical change in the spirit. And thus, as the
spirit of Edgar A. Poe started forth on its celestial journey, all that
bound him to earth still held a certain degree of influence over him.
“Life is one eternal progress,” and only by progression and the gradual
development of his nobler nature could he outlive that bondage. In many
respects he had loved life and the things of earth. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span> his intercourse
with men he could not free himself from “the sins which did so easily
beset him.” Neither could he restrain that sensitiveness and
irritability of nature which so often destroyed the peace of his outer
and inner life, and therefore he must necessarily outgrow that in higher
conditions, and under more favorable influences. As he gradually
attained to a sublimer consciousness of the beautiful and true, much of
the wild and fitful fire peculiar to his genius departed from him, and
there came in its stead a majestic flow of inspiration, solemn and grand
as the music of the spheres. He saw that there were harmonious relations
awaiting him; and as his soul was rich in sympathy and love, he aspired
to those conditions, and he could not rest until he had attained unto
them. The hinderance to his perfect peace was in his own spirit, and he
realized it. It was for him the commencement of a mighty struggle,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“When the golden bowl,&mdash;life’s token,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Into shining shards was broken.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It would seem, then, as though conscious of his strength, he stood up
like a spiritual giant, ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span>claiming, “I am free! At last I am free!”
There was a complete expansion of his being as he drank in the celestial
air. He could not clearly understand the mysteries by which he was
surrounded, but he knew that there was a latent energy in his soul,
which, being more fully developed, would wrestle with these mighty
problems until he made the solution his own. As year after year, marking
great and important changes in human experience, rolled on, men who
remembered Poe as he was, said, “Now he rests from life’s labor; now he
sins and sorrows no more.”</p>

<p>But they did not know upon what a mighty battle-field he stood, neither
could they understand through what fires of purification he was passing.
But there he stood, contending bravely, not once losing faith in his
soul’s possibilities, and pressing earnestly forward to the desired
consummation. And in this he was not alone. O, no! There was with him a
whole host of moral heroes, who, conscious of their power to win the
victory, and quickened by the inspirations which they received from that
higher state of being, were striving, by the excelsior movement of the
soul, to attain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">{155}</a></span> those glory-encircled heights from whence they could
look calmly down upon the plane of their earthly existence.</p>

<p>Thus it was that, as they gradually arose higher and higher in the scale
of being, he and they could perceive that all sin, and sorrow, and evil
ended at length in blessing, and that truths, which were dim and
indistinct, which seemed aught but truths, came out into clear and
shining light, and in their heavens were stars of the first magnitude.
Thus, also, as he toiled on he became versed in the mysteries of the
spirit, not in mere moralities&mdash;for true religion, godliness or
spirituality, is the full, free, and complete development of man’s
entire being, both in the intellectual and moral. Science and
literature, art and religion, have been separated by mankind, because
they did not understand the true mystery of Godliness.</p>

<p>But in that higher life one of the first lessons taught to the soul is,
that all things have their uses. Even the low, animal passions, leading
man into error, into sin, sensuality, and evil, will thereby teach him
lessons of wisdom; will teach him to avoid the false and the untrue, and
also that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156">{156}</a></span> were rocks and quicksands upon which his bark had
almost foundered, and which in the future he must avoid. Whether it be
these lower passions, or the intellectual and moral, still each must
have its own appropriate manifestation.</p>

<p>And as all these capacities for growth and perception belong not to the
body but to the spirit, so the spirit, sweeping away into the great
Eternity, bears up all these powers of its wondrous mechanism with it,
and the vision of Ezekiel is realized; for “the living creature being
lifted up, the wheels are lifted up also.”</p>

<p>Each organ of the brain has its own magnetic circle, touching the one
upon another like the mechanism of a watch, and all governed by the
main-spring, which is the internal consciousness of man, the central
power of his being. This order in the change from the mortal to the
immortal is not lost, but finds a more harmonious surrounding. Thus,
when the spirit has ascended, with its increased power, with its
superior opportunities for observation and investigation of all the
truths of the universe, it learns this most important truth,&mdash;that not
in <i>one</i> direction, but in <i>all</i>, the spirit shall find its most free
and perfect development.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157">{157}</a></span></p>

<p>Thus having become familiar with the conditions of the higher life, the
one of whom we speak realized that it was not in the poetic element of
his being alone that he was to find inspiration, not in smooth flowing
numbers or cunning arrangements of human speech, but in the grand
harmony of the living whole&mdash;the perfect accord of his entire being. It
was necessary, in passing forth from the flesh, that he should learn
this simple lesson. He has endeavored by all the powers of his nature to
make its application; and he has succeeded. This night he gives his
“Farewell to Earth.” Not that he is to be divided forever in his
interest from Humanity, but, no longer incited by restlessness or
ambition, to express in rhythmic numbers the fiery thought within, no
longer drawn by the sordid interests of this earthly life, he can gaze
down upon this lower world and influence the minds of men, and still be
above them. He can still minister, as an Everlasting Truth and living
power, to the needs of Humanity; but as Poe, the individual, he is
willing to be forgotten. His personality, as far as human recognition is
concerned, can end here. He cares not that “this poor, paltry <i>me</i>
should be spun<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span> out into Infinity.” He says: “Let my soul speak, which
is the Divine Power. I have realized in myself the mysteries of
Godliness, and know now that I too am Divine. I have merged and lost my
will in the Great Will of the universe. I know now what heaven is; it is
beauty, perfection, harmony. I would live forever in that celestial air,
and draw in the vitalizing influences of truth. I do not desire to go
down to the lowly homes of earth, nor to mingle with men in their
contentions and selfish interests. I know that there is a Power guarding
and guiding all things, and I can trust those whom I have loved, or
those for whom I have cared, in that Almighty Hand. Whatever mysterious
manifestation of wisdom on the part of Divine Providence comes to
Humanity, I can say now, ‘It is well! Let the will of that Power be
done!’ I have then no work to perform for you. I have only to carry with
me through the vast Eternity an open nature, that I may receive truths,
and, in passing onward, transmit them to those who are to follow after
me.”</p>

<p>Thus it is with all great and earnest souls. “The mystery of Godliness,”
or true spirituality, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span> an impelling and inspiring power, is behind
them, making itself manifest through their being. It also stands before
them, beckoning them on the way. It may be they have natures of steel
and fire, and that a thought electric strikes upon the heart, and sits,
a mania, on the brain. But still they feel that power impelling and
persuading, and finally when they perceive that the grand current of
human events is tending towards the great ocean of Infinite Truth, they
are willing to let their own peculiarities and characteristic tendencies
also flow on in the great stream, and so harmony is at length
established, not only with themselves but all.</p>

<p>The lesson of Poe’s life, in itself, was worth much to Humanity. In
coming time, others besides ourselves will dissect and analyze his
peculiar nature, and present it, even as we have, to men, as an instance
of that Spirit which was “made manifest in the flesh, which was seen of
angels, was preached by inspired lips to Humanity, believed on in the
world, and received up into glory.” Great, indeed, is the mystery of
Godliness! great in the light of the human lives that come and go upon
the broad arena of earthly existence. Great, also, is that mystery as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span>
made manifest in those spirits who go forth from the flesh, and feeling
the Divine inspiration stirring within them, seek for life,&mdash;Eternal
Life,&mdash;in order that they may grow and expand to the fulness of their
spiritual being, having within themselves a quenchless thirst for the
harmonious and the beautiful. They are true to the great law of spirit,
for whether in Time or Eternity, it may still be said that,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Within the heart of man there is a constant yearning<br /></span>

<p class="nind">Thus was it with Poe. Not clearly discerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_161" id="page_161">{161}</a></span> the purposes of life, he
did not bend his efforts to one high and holy aim. His nature was
wandering and erratic. This is also <i>his</i> present view of his earthly
life. “He has cast away his laurel wreath of fame,” and now upon his
brow, burning brightly with the glories of the celestial sphere, is an
olive wreath of peace. He stands now as a majestic soul, self-poised and
harmonious. Yet he has not lost aught of the brilliancy and fire of his
genius.</p>

<p>Edgar A. Poe was mighty in the flesh; and in the spirit he is mightier
far. His manifestations will yet come to mankind, but not as from the
individual. They will speak to your souls; they will breathe in words of

rather than as the utterances of him who was once known among men as

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
